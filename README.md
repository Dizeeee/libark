# libark

libark is a small test I made to get familiar with blockchain concepts. It's missing a lot in terms of functionality and there currently is no node software to use it with, but as a learning experience this was an incredibly helpful project for me to take on. I may update this project later with better tooling, documentation, and networking, but for now this was just a quick educational project.
